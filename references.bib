               alignment format for storing read alignments against reference
               sequences, supporting short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp)
               produced by different sequencing platforms. It is flexible in
               style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the
               format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are
               released. SAMtools implements various utilities for
               post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing,
               variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal
               tools for processing read alignments. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {Nearly all essential nuclear processes act on DNA packaged into arrays of nucleosomes. However, our understanding of how these processes (for example, DNA replication, RNA transcription, chromatin extrusion and nucleosome remodeling) occur on individual chromatin arrays remains unresolved. Here, to address this deficit, we present SAMOSA-ChAAT: a massively multiplex single-molecule footprinting approach to map the primary structure of individual, reconstituted chromatin templates subject to virtually any chromatin-associated reaction. We apply this method to distinguish between competing models for chromatin remodeling by the essential imitation switch (ISWI) ATPase SNF2h: nucleosome-density-dependent spacing versus fixed-linker-length nucleosome clamping. First, we perform in vivo single-molecule nucleosome footprinting in murine embryonic stem cells, to discover that ISWI-catalyzed nucleosome spacing correlates with the underlying nucleosome density of specific epigenomic domains. To establish causality, we apply SAMOSA-ChAAT to quantify the activities of ISWI ATPase SNF2h and its parent complex ACF on reconstituted nucleosomal arrays of varying nucleosome density, at single-molecule resolution. We demonstrate that ISWI remodelers operate as density-dependent, length-sensing nucleosome sliders, whose ability to program DNA accessibility is dictated by single-molecule nucleosome density. We propose that the long-observed, context-specific regulatory effects of ISWI complexes can be explained in part by the sensing of nucleosome density within epigenomic domains. More generally, our approach promises molecule-precise views of the essential processes that shape nuclear physiology.},

In this study, we use nanopore sequencing to evaluate CpG methylation and chromatin accessibility simultaneously on long strands of DNA by applying GpC methyltransferase to exogenously label open chromatin. We performed nanopore sequencing of nucleosome occupancy and methylome (nanoNOMe) on four human cell lines (GM12878, MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). The single-molecule resolution allows footprinting of protein and nucleosome binding, and determination of the combinatorial promoter epigenetic signature on individual molecules. Long-read sequencing makes it possible to robustly assign reads to haplotypes, allowing us to generate a fully phased human epigenome, consisting of chromosome-level allele-specific profiles of CpG methylation and chromatin accessibility. We further apply this to a breast cancer model to evaluate differential methylation and accessibility between cancerous and noncancerous cells.},

We developed two methods that implement tagmentation and use 90--99\% less input than current protocols: (1) single-molecule real-time sequencing by tagmentation (SMRT-Tag), which allows detection of genetic variation and CpG methylation; and (2) single-molecule adenine-methylated oligonucleosome sequencing assay by tagmentation (SAMOSA-Tag), which uses exogenous adenine methylation to add a third channel for probing chromatin accessibility. SMRT-Tag of 40\,ng or more human DNA (approximately 7,000 cell equivalents) yielded data comparable to gold standard whole-genome and bisulfite sequencing. SAMOSA-Tag of 30,000--50,000 nuclei resolved single-fiber chromatin structure, CTCF binding and DNA methylation in patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts and uncovered metastasis-associated global epigenome disorganization. Tagmentation thus promises to enable sensitive, scalable and multimodal single-molecule genomics for diverse basic and clinical applications.},

However, existing approaches, limited by reliance on DNA fragmentation and short-read sequencing, cannot provide information about large-scale chromatin states or reveal coordination between the states of distal regulatory elements. We have developed a method for profiling the accessibility of individual chromatin fibers, a single-molecule long-read accessible chromatin mapping sequencing assay (SMAC-seq), enabling the simultaneous, high-resolution, single-molecule assessment of chromatin states at multikilobase length scales. Our strategy is based on combining the preferential methylation of open chromatin regions by DNA methyltransferases with low sequence specificity, in this case EcoGII, an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase, and the ability of nanopore sequencing to directly read DNA modifications. We demonstrate that aggregate SMAC-seq signals match bulk-level accessibility measurements, observe single-molecule nucleosome and transcription factor protection footprints, and quantify the correlation between chromatin states of distal genomic elements.},

Our software can handle methylation output generated from a range of different methylation callers and manages large datasets using a compressed data format. To fully explore the methylation patterns in a dataset, NanoMethViz allows plotting of data at various resolutions. At the sample-level, we use dimensionality reduction to look at the relationships between methylation profiles in an unsupervised way. We visualize methylation profiles of classes of features such as genes or CpG islands by scaling them to relative positions and aggregating their profiles. At the finest resolution, we visualize methylation patterns across individual reads along the genome using the spaghetti plot and heatmaps, allowing users to explore particular genes or genomic regions of interest. In summary, our software makes the handling of methylation signal more convenient, expands upon the visualization options for nanopore data and works seamlessly with existing methylation analysis tools available in the Bioconductor project.

  abstract = {Long-read sequencing technologies have transformed the field of epigenetics by enabling direct, single-base resolution detection of DNA modifications, such as methylation. This produces novel opportunities for studying the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation, imprinting, and disease. However, the unique characteristics of long-read data, including the modBAM format and extended read lengths, necessitate the development of specialised software tools for effective analysis. The NanoMethViz package provides a suite of tools for loading in long-read methylation data, visualising data at various data resolutions. It can convert the data for use with other Bioconductor software such as bsseq, DSS, dmrseq and edgeR to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In this workflow article, we demonstrate the process of converting modBAM files into formats suitable for comprehensive downstream analysis. We leverage NanoMethViz to conduct an exploratory analysis, visually summarizing differences between samples, examining aggregate methylation profiles across gene and CpG islands, and investigating methylation patterns within specific regions at the single-read level. Additionally, we illustrate the use of dmrseq for identifying DMRs and show how to integrate these findings into gene-level visualization plots. Our analysis is applied to a triplicate dataset of haplotyped long-read methylation data from mouse neural stem cells, allowing us to visualize and compare the characteristics of the parental alleles on chromosome 7. By applying DMR analysis, we recover DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualise the methylation patterns of these genes summarised at single-read resolution. Through DMR analysis, we identify DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualize their methylation patterns at single-read resolution.

  abstract = {The organization of nucleosomes across the genome influences gene regulation, and understanding the mechanisms that underlie this organization in different organisms is an active area of research. In this study, genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions in three primary human cell types and in vitro have been generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Most of the genome exhibits substantial flexibility of nucleosome positions, and a combination of intrinsic sequence-based nucleosome preferences and interactions with non-nucleosomal factors determine nucleosome organization in vivo.},

  abstract = {We present a genome-scale method to map the single-molecule co-occupancy of structurally distinct nucleosomes, subnucleosomes, and other protein-DNA interactions via long-read high-resolution adenine methyltransferase footprinting. Iteratively Defined Lengths of Inaccessibility (IDLI) classifies nucleosomes on the basis of shared patterns of intranucleosomal accessibility, into: i.) minimally-accessible chromatosomes; ii.) octasomes with stereotyped DNA accessibility from superhelical locations (SHLs) {\textpm}1 through {\textpm}7; iii.) highly-accessible unwrapped nucleosomes; and iv.) subnucleosomal species, such as hexasomes, tetrasomes, and other short DNA protections. Applying IDLI to mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) chromatin, we discover widespread nucleosomal distortion on individual mammalian chromatin fibers, with {$>$}85\% of nucleosomes surveyed displaying degrees of intranucleosomally accessible DNA. We observe epigenomic-domain-specific patterns of distorted nucleosome co-occupancy and positioning, including at enhancers, promoters, and mouse satellite repeat sequences. Nucleosome distortion is programmed by the presence of bound transcription factors (TFs) at cognate motifs; occupied TF binding sites are differentially decorated by distorted nucleosomes compared to unbound sites, and degradation experiments establish direct roles for TFs in structuring binding-site proximal nucleosomes. Finally, we apply IDLI in the context of primary mouse hepatocytes, observing evidence for pervasive nucleosomal distortion in vivo. Further genetic experiments reveal a role for the hepatocyte master regulator FOXA2 in directly impacting nucleosome distortion at hepatocyte-specific regulatory elements in vivo. Our work suggests extreme---but regulated---plasticity in nucleosomal DNA accessibility at the single-molecule level. Further, our study offers an essential new framework to model transcription factor binding, nucleosome remodeling, and cell-type specific gene regulation across biological contexts.},
